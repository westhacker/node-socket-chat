# node-socket-chat Demos and Examples

A collection of node-socket-chat, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

# Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* All content is open source and just enjoy it
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@westhacker](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate

# Installation

* Download the latest NodeJS and finish the installation in windows.
* Run NodeJS in commandline and start the server.
* Open html file with Chrome or other supported explorers. For testing, open another one, then chat with each other.

# Warning

* No broadcast can be used in this edition of node-websocket-server.
* No tests have been done in linux and mac.

# Content
